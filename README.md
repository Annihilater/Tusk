## Running or Updating the code locally
If you want to hack on the code...

Tools needed:
* [Node.Js](http://nodejs.org/) - prerequisite for other dev tools
* [Grunt.js](gruntjs.com) - for less/css processing, packaging, and copying libs to the lib folder
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - for dependencies (libraries)

1) Clone the codebase, and then (from the code folder) run ```bower install``` to install the dependencies.  
2) Then ```grunt updatelib``` to copy the dependencies to their lib location.  
3) If you are editing ```.less``` files then run ```grunt watch``` to compile them when they change.

To install the code in Chrome, open More Tools\Extensions, check the "Developer mode" checkbox.  Click "Load unpacked extension" and browse to the folder where you cloned the code.  You may find the [Chrome Apps & Extensions Developer Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-apps-extensions-de/ohmmkhmmmpcnpikjeljgnaoabkaalbgc) to be helpful when debugging the background page.
